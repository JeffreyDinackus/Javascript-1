    On this page I will post YouTube channels and resources I know and post my opinion of them
    and who they will be good for. Some will just be links and I won&apos;t explain them. If there is a lot of interest I may go back and explain them. This is enough to get you started if you are diligent.

  <p>Good online bible, has most translations. Start reading with Matthew or Matthew and Genesis if you are interested in ancient history.</p>

  <p>Awesome weekly show that runs for about two hours on Friday nights. It&apos;s a great way to learn what it really means to be a christian if you have the time.</p>

      This website has a bunch of graphs on it, and the first one is the most
      important. It shows the difference between what the businesses are making
      off of labor vs how much they are paying back to their employees.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you don&apos;t know how to read graphs you need to work on that as a lot of
      truth comes in graph form. Try searching on YouTube how to do it.

  <p>This is a good way to learn the basics of a lot of different stuff for free from pretty good instructors. They also have a website where you can earn a certificate for free which mostly focuses on web development technologies and data science. The YouTube page has a wide variety. Some of the instructors are not great at explaining but it is free and I have found that if I try a few I will find some I like. They always provide a github of the project so you can troubleshoot your code.</p>

<p>This is a really good website to get courses on tech especially but other things like music too. If you want to pursue a CompTIA certification you can find some good series for a modest price such as the ones by James Dion, or Mike Meyers. I have only done James Dion&apos;s course on Linux+ which was good. James Dion&apos;s practice questions are decent. I also like Stephane Maarek&apos;s AWS courses but you have to get the practical experience on your own.</p>
<p>There are courses on just about anything but it is focuses on web development, make sure to read reviews before buying.</p>
<p>Wait until courses go on sale for 10-20 dollars. Do not buy for full price.</p>
